# MADLIBS

## description

I wanted to create an anm application that would help me branch out and try to branch out more with understaning pyhton. I made a madlib from following along with the youtuber [Kylie Ying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=100s) at freecodecamp.org. Python is a new code for me to learn so I wanted to start back from teh beginning and review all that I have learned so far.
